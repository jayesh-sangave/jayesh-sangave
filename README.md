## Hi! I'm Jxy ðŸ‘‹  

Captain at **MIT Tech Team**.  
Third-year **Computer Science major**.  
 
**Currently:**  
- rebuilding something that worked yesterday.

**Side quests:**  
- Experimenting with game networking and real-time systems.  
- Automating the parts of my work Iâ€™d rather not do twice.  
 

> I spend most of my time fixing features I proudly added last week.
